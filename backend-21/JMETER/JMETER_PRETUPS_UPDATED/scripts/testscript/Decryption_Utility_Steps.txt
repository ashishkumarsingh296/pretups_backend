**********************Steps to be followed for Decryption Utility*************************************

          1. Keep attached jar inside "Jmeter_folder/lib/ext"
          
          2. Edit " user.properties" which resides in bin folder inside jmeter and search for parameter "user.classpath". Uncomment it and enter value :                         

	 Path_to_jmeter/jmeter_folder/lib/ext/ DecryptionUtility.jar
               
          3. Now open Jmeter and in any test plan add " BeanShell Sampler" 
                
           4. Inside BeanShell Sampler, write following code to store value of decrypted pin inside variable name A1 and use this value further :
                                
                                
                                import simulator.decryptutility.BTSLUtil; //importing the package and class
                                import java.util.*;
                                import java.lang.*;
                                import java.io.*;

                                BTSLUtil jt = new BTSLUtil(); //Initiating an object
                                String[]  pin  = new String[2];
                                //PIN is a user defined variable which contains encrypted string
                                pin[0] = vars.get("PIN");
                                String dec;
                                dec = jt.main(pin);
                                vars.put("A1", dec); //Writing a value into Jmeter variable
                                log.info("decrypted value is "+ dec);

           
          Note :- 3rd and 4th step has been already done in Vietnam JMX . So ignore in this case else applicable for other JMX that require decryption utility.
