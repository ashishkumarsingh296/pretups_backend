#	Values of the variables in this file should be updated with the values provided by the

#Indicates whether Cancel request supported by IN or not.(Possible values are Y/N)

##If any ambiguous response is received from IN, then retry/cancel command is sent to IN. Then response of retry/cancel is matched in the IN file and mapped error code (250/206/200) is picked and sent to Controller.

##If any ambiguous response is received from IN, check if cancel txn allowed or not in the system. if not, pick mapped error code against NA otherwise pick mapped error code (206/250) against received response code of Cancellation from IN.
