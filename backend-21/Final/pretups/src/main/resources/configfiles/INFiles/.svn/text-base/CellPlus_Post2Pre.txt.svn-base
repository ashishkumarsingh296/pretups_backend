## SIZE_CHECK_REQUIRED represents that the size check on records of POSTPIAD_CUST_PAY_MASTER on the diffrent services.
## The services on which this check is applicable will be defined in the PreTUPS System. 
## The name of service which is mentioned here only on those services this check will be applicable. 
## To represent more than one service value will be seperated by comma. for e.g. BILLPMT,PRE-POST.

## <SERVICE_TYPE>_SERVICE_TYPE. It represents the service types allowed for the defined service type. 
## if there is more than one allowed service types, then allowed service types will be defined as comma seperated, 
## for e.g. BILLPMT,PRE-POST.
## The syntax of entry will be as mentione below
## <SERVICE_TYPE>_SERVICE_TYPE. <SERVICE_TYPE> it will be replaced by service type name. 
##  service type name will be Service types defined in the system.
## if it requires to define more service types for which different services are allowed, then there will be more entry of such type. 
## for e.g. 
## 1.) BILLPMT_SERVICE_TYPE=BILLPMT ----- for Bill payment service
## 2.) PRE-POST_SERVICE_TYPE=BILLPMT,PRE-POST ----- for Prepaid to Postpaid service
## apart from above mentioned value the value of service type can be blank or ALL.

## <SERVICE_TYPE>_ALLOWED_QUEUE_SIZE. It represents the queue size for defined service type.
## if more than one service type is defined as comma separated then it will be applicale for the both service type 
## The syntax of entry will be as mentione below
## <SERVICE_TYPE>_ALLOWED_QUEUE_SIZE. <SERVICE_TYPE> it will be replaced by service type name. 
##  service type name will be Service types defined in the system.
## if it require to define queue size for more service type, then there will be more entry of such type.

## INTERFACE_CLASS represent Fully qualified name of CDR Record generation class. This Class will 
# be different for the different postapaid interfaces.
INTERFACE_CLASS=com.btsl.pretups.inter.post.cdr.CellplusCDRRecordGeneration

## RECORD_SIZE represent the size of single record in the CDR file. it is in bytes i.e. number of characters in a record. 
RECORD_SIZE=256

## SERVICE_TYPE represent, that this Process is applicable for which services. Services are defined in PreTUPS system. 
## if there is more than one srvice then value will be comma seperated. for e.g. 
## if there are two service like BILLPMT and PRE_POST, then expected value will be BILLPMT,PRE_POST.
SERVICE_TYPE=POST-PRE

## TIME_CONSTRAINT fields represent, that whether the time slot of process can be initialize to 00:00 hrs or not.
## The expected value for this is 'Y' or 'N'. If it is N then the process will not initialize at 00:00 hrs. 
## If it is Y then the process will be initialize at 00:00 hrs. deafult value of this will be Y
## for e.g. The file interval is 4 hrs. While CDR file processing, the time slot generated are,   
## 1.) 17/05/06 7:00 P.M to 17/05/06 11:00 P.M
## 2.) 17/05/06 11:01 P.M to 18/05/06 00:00 A.M --------- initialized at 00:00 hrs
## 3.) 18/05/06 00:01 A.M to 18/05/06 04:00 A.M
## as above mentioned time slot, the time slot is initialized at 00:00 hrs. only if TIME_CONSTRTAINT is Y. 
## other wise the slot will be like as mentoined below
## 1.) 17/05/06 7:00 P.M to 17/05/06 11:00 P.M
## 2.) 17/05/06 11:01 P.M to 18/05/06 03:00 A.M --------- not initialized at 00:00 hrs

FILE_INTERVAL=1

## FILE_SIZE_RECORD represent that whether the file size will depend upon no of records in the file or size of file in bytes 
## possible value can be are 'Y' and 'N'.
## If value is Y: the size of file will depend upon number of records. 
## If it is N then size will depend upon size of file like MB.
FILE_SIZE_RECORD=Y

## FILE_SIZE represent the isze of file. if FILE_SIZE_RECORD is Y then it is number of record.
