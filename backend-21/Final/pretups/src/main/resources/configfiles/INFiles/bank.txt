#	BANK IN file
#	If IN interface of BANK is added in PreTUPS from superadmin then.
#	File with this content and name of the IN ID.txt should be created at
#	the 
#	path of the INFiles (defined in Constants.props).
#	
#	Values of the variables in this file should be updated with the values
#	provided by the 
#	Mobile Operator IN team
#
#	Define the interface id as value of SCH_IN_IDS in the Constants.props
