#       CS3 IN file
#       If IN interface of CS3 is added in PreTUPS from superadmin then.
#       File with this content and name of the IN ID.txt should be created at
#       the path of the INFiles (defined in Constants.props).
#      Values of the variables in this file should be updated with the values
#       provided by the

#
#       Define the interface id as value of SCH_IN_IDS in the Constants.props
