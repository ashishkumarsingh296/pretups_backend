## SIZE_CHECK_REQUIRED represents that the size check on records of POSTPIAD_CUST_PAY_MASTER on the diffrent services.
## The services on which this check is applicable will be defined in the PreTUPS System. 
## The name of service which is mentioned here only on those services this check will be applicable. 
## To represent more than one service value will be seperated by comma. for e.g. BILLPMT,PRE-POST.

SIZE_CHECK_REQUIRED=BILLPMT,PRE-POST

## <SERVICE_TYPE>_SERVICE_TYPE. It represents the service types allowed for the defined service type. 
## if there is more than one allowed service types, then allowed service types will be defined as comma seperated, 
## for e.g. BILLPMT,PRE-POST.
## The syntax of entry will be as mentione below
## <SERVICE_TYPE>_SERVICE_TYPE. <SERVICE_TYPE> it will be replaced by service type name. 
##  service type name will be Service types defined in the system.
## if it requires to define more service types for which different services are allowed, then there will be more entry of such type. 
## for e.g. 
## 1.) BILLPMT_SERVICE_TYPE=BILLPMT ----- for Bill payment service
## 2.) PRE-POST_SERVICE_TYPE=BILLPMT,PRE-POST ----- for Prepaid to Postpaid service
## apart from above mentioned value the value of service type can be blank or ALL.

## <SERVICE_TYPE>_ALLOWED_QUEUE_SIZE. It represents the queue size for defined service type.
## if more than one service type is defined as comma separated then it will be applicale for the both service type 
## The syntax of entry will be as mentione below
## <SERVICE_TYPE>_ALLOWED_QUEUE_SIZE. <SERVICE_TYPE> it will be replaced by service type name. 
##  service type name will be Service types defined in the system.
## if it require to define queue size for more service type, then there will be more entry of such type. 
## for e.g. 
## 1.) BILLPMT_ALLOWED_QUEUE_SIZE=6 ----- for Bill payment service

## TIME_CONSTRAINT fields represent, that whether the time slot of process can be initialize to 00:00 hrs or not.

## If it is Y then the process will be initialize at 00:00 hrs. deafult value of this will be Y
## for e.g. The file interval is 4 hrs. While CDR file processing, the time slot generated are,   
## 1.) 17/05/06 7:00 P.M to 17/05/06 11:00 P.M
## 2.) 17/05/06 11:01 P.M to 18/05/06 00:00 A.M --------- initialized at 00:00 hrs
## 3.) 18/05/06 00:01 A.M to 18/05/06 04:00 A.M
## as above mentioned time slot, the time slot is initialized at 00:00 hrs. only if TIME_CONSTRTAINT is Y. 
## other wise the slot will be like as mentoined below
## 1.) 17/05/06 7:00 P.M to 17/05/06 11:00 P.M
## 2.) 17/05/06 11:01 P.M to 18/05/06 03:00 A.M --------- not initialized at 00:00 hrs

## If it is N then size will depend upon size of file like MB.
